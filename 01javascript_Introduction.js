// there are three ways by which we can define variable

// 1. var
// 2. let
// 3 const



// var a(identifier) =(operator) 7(literal);



// var is global scoped variable

// var a = 5;
// console.log(a);
// a = "javascript"; (we can reassigned in var)
// console.log(a);


// let is block level variable
// let b = 5;
// console.log(b);
// let b = "javascript"; (we cannot reassigned in let )
// console.log(b)



// rules for choosing variable names

// letterr, digits and underscore are allowed;

// let a = 5 (it will work)
//let $a = 5 (it will word)

//let _a = 5 (it will not work);
//let 5a = 5 (it will not work);
//let #a = 5 (it will not work);

// it must starts with letters or $

// javascript reserved word cannot be used as a variable name;

// let var and const

// the var keyword was used in javascript from 1995 to 2015 and the let and const keyword were added in 2015;

// var

// var can be updated and can be redeclared

// var a = 10;
// var a = 20(it will work)
// a = 30; (it will also work)

// const

//const can neither be updated nor be redeclared
// const x = 10;
// x = 5; (it will not work)
